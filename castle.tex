  When K. arrived, it was late in the night, \\
  The village was covered under deep snow, \\
  And the castle hill was nowhere in sight. \\
  Fog and darkness enveloped him and though \\
  The sky's faintest glow of light could not show \\
  The outline of the great castle, K. stood \\
  On the wooden bridge, the darkness below, \\
  The seeming emptiness was understood \\
  To offer our hero the start of something good.

  And then, a decisive intake of air, \\
  K. descended to the village below \\
  Hoping to find lodgings anywhere there. \\
  In the inn, peasants still stirred to and fro \\
  In spite of the hour. There were no rooms, though \\
  The Innkeeper offered a sack of straw, \\
  And K.'s weariness had brought him so low \\
  That he eagerly accepted as fair \\
  The innkeeper's offer to sleep on the floor there. \\

  But soon then K. was roused from his slumber \\
  By a young man with a thespian's face. \\
  The peasants were still there too in number \\
  And many had turned from their beer in case \\
  An entertaining spectacle took place. \\
  The young man was dressed in fancy city \\
  Clothes; his eyes were narrowed; it seemed the case \\
  The young man was the son of a pretty \\
  Big deal, and he was not trying to be witty!
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
    \begin{center}
    \textbf{4} \\
  \end{center}
A big deal indeed, the son of the castle \\
Steward stood over K., his eyebrows strong, \\
He was polite but ready to hassle \\
Our poor K. over his excursion along \\
The village's outskirts lurking among \\
The shadows and darkness of the late hour. \\
You have entered the village was his song, \\
And the right to stay in any bower \\
Or hut, resided only in Count Westwest's power.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}

  \end{center}
Half sitting up and straightening his hair \\
K. nonchalantly glanced up at the crowd;  \\
The innkeeper, the peasants in their chairs,  \\
The young man asking if K. should be allow'd, \\
all waiting there for K. to speak out loud \\
His intentions on such a snowy night. \\
"Where am I?" K. asked as if he were proud \\
of his ignorance,  "I'm lost in the night." \\
He cried, "Castle you say? But there was not one in sight."
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
  \begin{center}
    \textbf{6} \\
  \end{center}
  The young man was astonished by K.'s act, \\
  "Why indeed, the castle of Count Westwest!" \\
  "And you need permission," asked K. "in fact \\
  for a weary travellor to simply rest \\
  overnight?" at last upon being press'd \\
  By the expecting crowd. Was it a dream \\
  That gave to him the notion that a guest \\
  Could be cruelly turned out? Truly it seem'd \\
  To beggar belief. Such cruelty K. could not gleam.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
  \begin{center}
    \textbf{7} \\
  \end{center}
  "You must have permission!" was the reply. \\
  And with that, the dramatic young man turn'd \\
  To his audience, and said with a sigh, \\
  "Or maybe it's not required to have earn'd \\
  The Count's blessings!" And now having so learn'd \\
  The conditions of discretely dwelling \\
  overnight, grasping that which so concern'd \\
  the crowd, K. yawned, and perhaps overselling \\
  his nonchalance, announced his plans without yelling.
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
  \begin{center}
    \textbf{8} \\
  \end{center}
  "Now, if it is permission that I need," \\
  Said K. "Then it is permission I seek." \\
  And as if he were about to proceed, \\
  Cast off his blanket with nary a peek \\
  At the shocked crowd, barely able to speak. \\
  "Permission from whom?" sputtered the young man, \\
  "At this midnight hour?" he said with a shreik. \\
  "It isn't possible?" and K. began \\
  To yawn and stretch. "See, I like to sleep when I can!"
